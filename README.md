# SideComments.js

Version 0.0.1

SideComments.js is a UI component to give you [Medium.com](http://medium.com/) style comment management on the front-end. It allows users to comment directly on sections of content rather than the boring comment stream on the bottom of the page that we're so used to. This component manages the interface of how your comments are presented and allows you to decide how to manage your comments on the server.
